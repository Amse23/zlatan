The following steps best describe the progression:
1. Azure Infrastructure with Terraform
2. Python Script for Data Population
3. PII Detection and Masking Solution

# Azure Infra with Terraform
Resources created with Terraform in order are: Azure Resource Group, Azure Storage Account, Azure Table, Azure SQL server, and Azure Databse
Azure data factory also provisioned via Terraform. In the next step, files were pushed to Github by Git commands.
